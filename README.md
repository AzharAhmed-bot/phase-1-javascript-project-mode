# TITLE: Comic Book Store Web Application

This is a front-end web application intended to display and sell comic books. It uses JavaScript to fetch and display data from a local server running on http://localhost:3000/comics.

# Features or Description

Displays all available comics from the server in styled card elements.
Allows users to search for a specific comic by title.
If a comic title is found, displays detailed information about the selected comic including its image, description, price, availability status and an option to leave feedback.
Users can leave feedback/comments by submitting a form with their comment.
Users can purchase a comic by clicking on the "Buy Now" button. If the selected comic has an available stock, the available stock is decremented by one and the result is displayed on the page. If the available stock reaches zero, the comic is removed from the store.
If a user tries to buy a book that is out of stock, they receive an alert message.
